# Dailytrends Frontend

This is the frontend of the DailyTrends application, a digital newspaper that allows you to view the cover articles of the two most important newspapers in Spain.

## FAQ
* Why are there two different sections of news?
  * There are some news that come with a picture and others without it, I found horrible to distribute all of them in the same space.
* What do the 'El Mundo' and 'El Pa√≠s' sections have?
  * The main page has only the latest 5 news. Every 30 minutes the backend stores new news, so I think it's a shame to miss that. In these sections you can access the full content of each newspaper.

## Requirements
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
